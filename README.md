### 👋 Hi, I’m Harsh Saini.

👀 I’m interested in web development, specifically in frontend frameworks like React.js and Next.js, and backend technologies such as Node.js and MongoDB. I enjoy creating dynamic and responsive web applications. I also love C++ and problem-solving.

🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript to enhance my development skills and improve the robustness of my code. I'm also working on backend development involving authentication and authorization using JWT tokens and MongoDB.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to eCommerce applications, MERN stack projects, and any innovative web development projects where I can contribute and learn.

⚡ Fun fact: I have a special talent for finding bugs in my code just seconds after declaring it bug-free. My friends say I should list "Professional Bug Hunter" on my resume!
